Tic - Tac - Toe
========================

###Building a tic tac toe game with basic html, css, js

##Goals

###Basic Requirements

- [x] Complete the HTML code required to display the game board
- [ ] Implement the JavaScript required to make the board interactive
- [ ] Customize the CSS to make a better looking user interface

###Tasks

####Complete the HTML

- Examine the code for `index.html` file in your text editor.
- Notice that there is a `<div>` with a class called 'board'. Inside that `<div>`, there is another `<div>` with 3 buttons that have id's of 0, 1, and 2.
- These buttons make up the first row of the tic-tac-toe board. You need to create the other two rows. Use what you see as a guide to create those two additional rows. *Hint - Each button needs a unique `id` number. Do you see why?*
- Right now your project folder has a file called `script.js`. Problem is, it's not linked to the `index.html` file! Add a JavaScript link in your `index` file.
- Right now your project folder has a file called `style.css`. Problem is, it's not linked to the `index.html` file! Add a CSS link in your `index` file.
- There is a button provided for you with an id of 'reset', but right now it doesn't do anything. Add an event handler that resets the board when you click this button. 
*Hint - You can use the same function that already gets called when the page loads.*


####Complete the JavaScript

- Examine the code for `script.js` file in your text editor. Carefully read through the code to get an understanding for what it does.
- Some of the functions are fully implemented, and some only partially or not at all. Read the commented lines for instructions and hints, and implement all of the JavaScript functions to make the game work correctly.


####Complete the CSS

- Even after you've linked the CSS, this game still looks pretty bad! Add some styling to your game by modifying the `style.css` file. Be creative and make your version unique!
